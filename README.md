# Recipe App

The Recipe App is a web application built using the MERN stack that focuses on managing recipes. It utilizes MongoDB as the database and uses Mongoose for interacting with the database. Authentication in the app is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for secure user authentication and authorization. The Recipe App provides an intuitive interface for users to register, login, create recipes, and store their favorite recipes. The focus of this app is on functionality rather than design, providing a straightforward and intuitive user interface.
